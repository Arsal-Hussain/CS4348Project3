Started Project 3: B-Tree index manager.

Goal: Implement a file-based B-Tree index system that supports `create`, `insert`, and `search`. 
Initial version (`project3.py`) already supports those 3 commands without node splitting.
Plan: 
- Make a Git repo to track all changes.
- Add more commands (`print`, `extract`, `load`) later.
- Handle node splitting next.
